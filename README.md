Hi there!

I'm glad to show you my coursework. I with my team were working on it approximately for 3 months.

We tried to teach a popular neural network architecture GPT-2 to generate job offers in "HR style" using models from HuggingFace (such a cool resource, by the way!).

Here you can see what we have in the result.

It was my first meeting with NLP task and I had to rapidly dive in this subject. Because of it I probably have some holes in my knowledge.

Anyway it was interesting and advisable for me))

There are unique little .txt files in the repositories, which explain you its capacity.
